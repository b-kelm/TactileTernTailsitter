# Test Flight Protocol

## 28.01.2024 MAIDEN

### Hover Flight
* Successful hover, little dampening, rather aggressive
* -> Reduce gains, for pitch & roll by 30%, reduce yaw rate by 30%

### Transitioning
* Only little time in this mode, but no issue, transitions back & forth quite well
* -> No changes here

### Forward Flight
* Pitches down quite rapidly. Max. Angles are too high (stalled wing...)
* -> Reduce max/min pitch angles to +-30Â°
